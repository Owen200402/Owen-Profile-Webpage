                Owen was born in Shanghai, China -- one of the busiest,
                prosperious metropolises worldwide. He moved to Canada at the
                age of 14 in grade 9. At that period, he struggled to make
                progress on his English. However, Owen has an indomitable
                spirit. He became brave to speak English with his friends.
                Eventually, he took the advantage of the environment he was
                living in to maximally elevate his English. Meanwhile, he seemed
                to find his career path through try-and-error. He became aware
                of the growth of technology industry. He first tried it out by
                taking Mosh Hamedani's ultimate java series. After he completed
                a third of it, he confidently shouted in front of his mom, "This
                is what I want!" He could sit in front of a computer and write
                code persistently for 3 hours. --"Writing a program that
                simulate a real world problem has so much fun!" Because of the
                passion, Owen digged into programming, kept his perserverance
                and attended competitions held by waterloo (Canadian Computing
                Competition) in which he scored decent marks.

                Owen has participated in a variety of volunteer activities in
                community. He has been involved and become one of the most
                popular tutors in his school's homework club. Students often
                feel satisfied from his tutoring. "Owen is very passionate about
                teaching and his approach of teaching made us easy to
                understand!" said by one of his formal tutees. He is extremely
                organized and willing to spend time preparing materials for his
                tutees, which is a trait that the majority of the other tutors
                do not have. Besides the homework club, he is also a vice
                president of Sunshine Foundation Piano Club. This club is a
                place where he organize events such as a virtual concert
                performance. He also helped raise funds for BC hospital
                donation, especially to kids who were in risks of death. During
                Covid, he also helped SDC (Social Diversity for Children
                Foundation) build classrooms for disabled students through an
                auction in which they collected 20k dollars. Furthermore, Owen
                also helped Quantum Academy edit video for their talent shows.
                They eventually received 100k dollars and donated all of them to
                BC hospital as well.

                At young age, Owen showed his strong passion in music, being
                obsessed into classical music in particular. He officially
                started to learn piano when he was 4. Owen insisted on becoming
                a great musician and practiced piano regularly and assiduously.
                He has gained tons of district and provincial prizes when he was
                in the middle school. He also accomplished RCM level 10
                practical exam quickly by spending 1 year practicing these
                designated music pieces and got an overall 90%. Last year
                December, Owen was stunned that he received the first place in
                an international competition -- Elite Music International
                Competition. His expectation for his future is never giving up
                playing music, catching every chance to improve his artistry
                even further. Moreover, he also thinks of music as a secondary
                major choice in University. Therefore, he is planning to join
                the live audition in 2021 in University of Mcgill. Wish him all
                the best.

            Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read
            in my life, and it triggered my passion for reading. The book is
            based on a simulated world in which technology dominates the world;
            people always use their technology negatively by neglecting
            face-to-face conversation, sports and social lives. Also, it
            captures a society in which books are strictly banned under
            censorship. If you collect books at home, the police can give you
            the death penalty, because they think you have an unchaste,
            distorted mind that can be harmful to the technology-disoriented
            society. Interestingly, with the alignment of the police's job,
            firemen are asked to burn the books rather than put out fires.
            Overall, this dystopian book has been a great inspiration to lots of
            young readers, since the story is highly related to our day-to-day
            life and it seems likely to happen in our lives as the technology
            industry is skyrocketing. It gives everyone a warning to not fully
            depend on technology, which would eventually lead to the tragic
            ending described in the book.

            I enjoyed reading the kite runner. This is one of the best
            non-fiction books I have ever read. The story reflects the cruelty
            of the war in Afghanistan's history. However, author Hosseni chose
            to focus more on a family's relationship, which brought me into
            tears a lot of times. There are many heartbreaking and heartwarming
            scenes inside that have been foreshadowed and somewhat predictable.
            One of the most valuable thing to me by reading this novel is that I
            developed my ability to imagine while reading, which increased my
            interest of reading as well. I strongly recommend this book to high
            school students, because the story was vividly depicted and could
            trigger their nerve to read more non-fictions. Once you read it, you
            can hardly put it down.

            Atomic Habits -- An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break
            Bad Ones. As its name, this book can let a person be aware his good
            or bad habits by applying effective implementations. This is the
            book that could have taken me a month to borrow from the library
            because of the long waiting list in front. However, I finally
            decided to buy it from a local bookstore. Honestly, this is the book
            that shaped my life the most; I felt the power of a fiction book.
            This book is structured clearly with visual graphs every five to ten
            pages and a little summary near the end of each chapter. The author
            discussed four core concepts of building and destorying every habit
            -- cue, craving, respose, and reward. While I was reading the book,
            I also tried to discover my habits and improve. Surprisingly, by
            applying these principles, I was able to detect my weeknesses / bad
            habits in my life and change them back in an astonishing speed. For
            example, I used to use my bath rope to clean my mouth after brushing
            my teeth because it was close to me. My mom was always being mad at
            me because of this bad habit. By applying the principles in this
            book, I completely got rid of this bad habit within two days. How
            fast! Hence, I highly recommend high-school and college students to
            give it a read. I guarantee you that there will be a huge postive
            change on you.
