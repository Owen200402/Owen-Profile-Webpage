                Hello everyone! My name is Owen, and I was born in Shanghai,
                China -- one of the busiest, prosperious metropolises. I moved
                to Canada in grade 9. As a newcomer, I struggled to make
                progress in English. However, I always belived in being
                optimistic as it could help me face the challenges positvely.
                That made me brave to speak English with my friends, and took
                the advantage of the environment I was living in to maximally
                elevate my English skills. Meanwhile, I found my career interest
                through trial-and-error in learning new skills across hundreds
                of fields. By spending time probing for different fields of
                study, I became aware of the growth of technology industry. I
                therefore challenged myself by taking Mosh Hamedani's Ultimate
                Java series. After I completed a third of it, I yelled to my
                mom, "This is what I want to do in my future!" My mom also
                supported my choice as she often saw me sitting in front of a
                computer and writing code persistently for 3 hours. -- "Writing
                a program that simulates a real world problem has so much fun!"
                Undaunted by the magic of seeing problems being solved in real
                time, I persisted in acquiring new coding knowldge from Mosh's
                tutorials daily and had taken part in coding competitions held
                by Waterloo (Canadian Computing Competition) in which I scored
                decent marks.

                I have been participating in a variety of volunteer activities
                in community. Last year, I become one of the most popular tutors
                in my school's homework club, and students often feel satisfied
                after being tutored. "Owen is very passionate about teaching and
                his approach of teaching made it easy to understand!" said by
                one of my formal tutees to the club department head. In fact, I
                was always being organized and willing to spend time preparing
                materials for my tutees. That is why the outcome yielded often
                shocked my tutees and myself. Besides the homework club, I was
                also a vice president of Sunshine Foundation Piano Club. This
                club was where I organized events such as a virtual concert
                performance. I also helped raise funds for BC hospital donation,
                especially to kids who were in risks of death because of the
                diseases they have infected. During Covid, I also joined SDC
                (Social Diversity for Children Foundation) charity, raising
                funds to help build classrooms for disabled students through an
                auction event in which they collected 30,000 PPE. Furthermore, I
                had also helped Quantum Academy edit videos for their talent
                shows. They eventually received 10k and donated all of them to
                BC hospitals.

                At young age, I showed my strong passion in music, being
                obsessed with classical music in particular. I started to learn
                piano since I was 4. I insisted on becoming a great musician so
                I practiced piano regularly and assiduously. After I started the
                primary school, tons of district and provincial prizes were
                offered as I constently sharpen my piano skills and learned new
                music pieces in all different styles. I also accomplished RCM
                level 10 practical exam after spending 1 year practicing the
                designated music pieces and got an overall 90% (distinction). I
                was stunned that I received the first place in international
                competitions -- Elite Music International Competition and French
                Vivace International Competition in 2021. Because of my passion
                and accomplishment in music, I would never give up playing
                classical music, catching every little chance to improve my
                artistry further. Moreover, I also think of music as a secondary
                majoring option in university. Therefore, I am planning to join
                the live audition in 2021 in University of Mcgill. Wish me all
                the best!

            Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read
            in my life, and it triggered my passion for reading. The book is
            based on a simulated world in which technology dominates; people
            always use their technology negatively by neglecting face-to-face
            conversation, sports and social lives. Also, it captures a society
            in which books are strictly banned under censorship. If you collect
            books at home, the police can give you the death penalty, because
            they think you have an unchaste, distorted mind that can be harmful
            to the technology-disoriented society. Interestingly, with the
            alignment of the police's job, firemen are asked to burn the books
            rather than to put out fires. Overall, this dystopian book has been
            a great inspiration to lots of young readers, since the story is
            highly related to our day-to-day life and it seems likely to happen
            in our lives as the technology industry is skyrocketing. It gives
            everyone a warning to not fully depend on technology, because it
            would eventually lead to the tragic ending described in the book.

            I enjoyed reading the Kite Runner. This is one of the best
            non-fiction books I have ever read. The story reflects the cruelty
            of the war in Afghanistan's history. However, author Hosseni chose
            to focus more on a family's relationship, which brought me into
            tears many times. There are many heartbreaking and heartwarming
            scenes that have been foreshadowed and somewhat predictable. One of
            the most valuable things to me by reading this novel is that I
            developed my ability to imagine while reading, which increased my
            interest in reading as well. I strongly recommend this book to high
            school students, because the story was vividly depicted and could
            trigger their nerve to read more non-fictions. Once you start
            reading it, you can hardly put it down.

            Atomic Habits -- An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break
            Bad Ones. As its name, this book can build awareness of one's good
            and bad habits by applying effective implementations to strength the
            good ones and break the bad ones. The book could have taken me a
            month to borrow from the library because of the long waiting list.
            However, I finally decided to buy one from a local bookstore.
            Honestly, this is the book that shaped my life the most; I felt the
            power of a fiction book. This book is structured clearly with visual
            graphs every five to ten pages and a little summary near the end of
            each chapter. The author discussed four core concepts of building
            and destorying every habit -- cue, craving, respose, and reward.
            While reading the book, I also tried to discover my bad habits and
            improve. Surprisingly, by applying these principles, I was able to
            detect my bad habits in my life and to change them in an astonishing
            speed. For example, I used to use my bathrobe to clean my mouth
            after brushing my teeth because it was close to me. My mom was
            always mad at me because of this bad habit. By applying the
            principles in this book, I completely got rid of this bad habit
            within two days. How fast! Hence, I highly recommend high-school and
            college students to give it a read. I guarantee that there will be a
            tramendous, postive change on you.

            1984 and Fahrenheit 451 share a lot of similarities as both of them
            are dystopian novels. However, not all of their contents are
            dystopian; more than three-quarter content in 1984 depicts a brutal,
            paralyzed world under totalitarian regimes — a ubiquitous phenomenon
            in World War II. George Orwell warned the contemporary society that
            every totalitarian country would likely end up being filled with
            censorship and ignorance as the world he described in the book, no
            matter it is communism or fascism. It is also a thought-provoking
            book, which made me assert that actions have to be taken in order
            for the oligarchy to come to an end. Otherwise, people will be
            totally controlled, confused by the world around them and end up
            having no ability to think logically, because they have to obey the
            dictators who presumptuously change the law or the constitutions
            whenever they want to. Any personal revolt will result in
            "disappearing" from this world.
