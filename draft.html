      I finally became a student in UBC in 2022. Lots of emotions bursts into my
      mind as I said goodbye to my parents, and I realized, it was the day
      leaving from my parents. From then on, I got to face challenges in my life
      alone. Although sounding scary, I longed for a self-designed university
      life, which, to me, symbolized freedom! Thanks UBC for organiing Jumpstart
      program, in which I made tons of friends that I kept contact with today.
      University life should not have a bad rep, which most of people think of,
      as if idiots cramming bugs all day in front of books and laptops. Overall,
      2023 was filled with fruits; I not only successfully acheived straight As,
      steped my foot into the world of computing, but also found my love,
      hopefully a forever love (photos of me and my girlfriend are attached in
      photos section of the page by the way).

      Within my first-year studying, I have made 2 computer science projects in
      classes. One of which is a java project that simulates a rating system for
      UBC libraries to give insights to new students as to which library would
      best suit their location, studying, and environment needs. All designs are
      made by myself and here is the link to its github repository: <br />

      Another project was made in my data science class, in which we trained our
      model in order to classify if a patient has got a benign or malignant
      tumor, and acheived a 72% success rate given unknown datasets. Here is the
      link:
