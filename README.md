This is my personal portfolio where I showcased my piano performance, high school and volunteer experiences. In Biography section, I also recommended
books that piqued my interests to readers (especially to high school students); most of the readings are philosophy-related, empowering teenagers to improve themselves on a long-run.
In addition, I organized a tutoring event where I welcome every tutor or tutee to come and register to assist students around the globe who need
help on their studies. This is completely free because our intention is to create a volunteer community for learners to learn and teachers
to gain experience. Click the Services icon to register!
